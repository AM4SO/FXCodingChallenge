Some ideas from past games 
 - moving average convergence/divergence
 - monte Carlo simulation
 - exponential moving average
 - abnormal volatility (linear regression using a sliding window to obtain the gradient and next px prediction)
 - RSI (relative strength index)

These are all to try to generate signals IFF you want to trade outside of the main events
